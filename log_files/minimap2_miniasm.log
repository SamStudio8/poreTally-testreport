START METHODS PRINTING
description: Minimap2 is a fast all-vs-all mapper of reads that relies on sketches of sequences, composed of minimizers. Miniasm uses the found overlaps to construct an assembly graph. As a consensus step is lacking in this pipeline, post-assembly polishing is often required.
